# Class-Website-Solution
A single place to get all the information about your classes from their pesky class websites.

This program is a JSDOM backend, React frontend way of getting objects around specific headers on class websites.
It was created to reduce the number of times I would look at the 2 class websites for this semester.

Further development
I want to create a UI that isn't hard coded, allow the user to choose the portions of the webpage to show, very similar to
an RSS feed but directly from the webpage itself.
